                QuickBooks' online checkout portal facilitates transactions between customers and
                merchants. Moving over $300 million USD every day, it is a crucial component of
                Intuit's technology platform.

                On top of serving as an all-in-one bookkeeping package, QuickBooks streamlines
                invoicing for small and medium-sized businesses (<abbr>SMB</abbr>s) through
                monitoring cash flow and offering a wide range of payment solutions to customers.

                    The QuickBooks checkout portal empowers small and medium-sized business owners

                Collaborating with 2 designers, 2 product managers, 3 engineers and 1 business
                analyst, I led a design iteration of the checkout experience to improve
                discoverability of existing features and scalability for novel payment options.

            <Paragraph>
                Analytics displayed subpar conversion rates for payment automation (Autopay), which
                might indicate poor discoverability or low receptiveness from users. The checkout
                portal's interface will also need to facilitate the introduction of two new
                transaction channels for invoice checkouts.

            <Paragraph>
                Customer-facing platforms such as QuickBooks are in a constant state of evolution,
                resulting in frequent design changes that must be approached with care. New features
                should be incorporated into an experience without interrupting the completion of its
                most critical tasks.

            </IndentInner>
            <Paragraph>
                Another implication of continuous refinement is the unfamiliarity of new features to
                even the most seasoned users. In the context of the QuickBooks checkout journey,
                there was a compromise to be made between preserving the simplicity of the checkout
                workflow and surfacing important information about what payment automation entails.
