                Intuit QuickBooks' online checkout portal facilitates transactions between customers and
                merchants. Moving over $300 million USD every day, it is a crucial component of
                Intuit's technology platform.

                Collaborating with two designers, two product managers, three engineers and a
                business analyst, I led a design iteration of the checkout experience to improve
                discoverability of existing features and scalability for novel payment options.

                Intuit's 2022 business objectives included introducing new payment options and
                increasing engagement of existing automation features. This entailed revisiting how
                interface components within the checkout portal were organized as well as leveraging
                analytics to uncover challenges with discoverability.

            <Paragraph>
                Customer-facing platforms such as QuickBooks are in a constant state of evolution,
                resulting in frequent design changes that must be approached with care. New features
                should be incorporated into an experience without interrupting the completion of its
                most critical tasks.

            </IndentInner>
            <Paragraph>
                Another implication of continuous refinement is the unfamiliarity of new features to
                even the most seasoned users. In the context of the QuickBooks checkout journey,
                there was a compromise to be made between preserving workflow simplicity and
                surfacing important information about what payment automation entails.
