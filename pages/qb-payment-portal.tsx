                QuickBooks' online payment portal facilitates transactions between customers and
                merchants. Moving over $300 million USD every day, it is a crucial component of
                Intuit's technology platform.

                Under Intuit's Small Business and Self-Employed Group (<abbr>SBSEG)</abbr>, I took
                on a project centered around the reconstruction of the QuickBooks Payment Portal. My
                responsibilities covered the entire design process â€” uncovering context, defining
                problems, outlining scope, executing interaction design, validating solutions, and
                facilitating workshops.

                    Working cross-functionally within a team distributed across three time zones, I
                    led an end-to-end redesign of the QuickBooks Payment Portal's customer-facing
                    experience.

            <Paragraph>
                The QuickBooks product roadmap saw the introduction of payment automation and new
                transaction channels for invoice checkouts. Analytics displayed subpar conversion
                rates for automation setup, which might indicate poor discoverability or low
                receptiveness from users.

                <Strong>
                    How can we better surface the QuickBooks Payment Portal's new automation
                    services and transaction options?
