                QuickBooks' online payment portal facilitates transactions between customers and
                merchants. Moving over $300 million USD every day, it is a crucial component of
                Intuit's technology platform.

                On top of serving as an all-in-one bookkeeping package, QuickBooks streamlines
                invoicing for small and medium-sized businesses (<abbr>SMB</abbr>s) through
                monitoring cash flow and offering a wide range of payment solutions to customers.

            <Paragraph>
                Analytics displayed subpar conversion rates for payment automation (Autopay), which
                might indicate poor discoverability or low receptiveness from users. The payment
                portal's interface will also need to facilitate the introduction of two new
                transaction channels for invoice checkouts.

                    How can we better surface QuickBooks Autopay while incorporating new transaction
                    channels?

            <Paragraph>
                While the post-confirmation modal dialogue enables us to introduce Autopay with a
                larger amount of content, minimizing the amount of text to read through remains a
                crucial objective. I would work in tandem with our content designer and the
                QuickBooks marketing team to iterate and validate these changes.

            <Paragraph>
                With Autopay's discoverability now being driven by the post-confirmation modal
                dialogue, I would look into further improving learnability for new payors. It would
                be interesting to see how moving third-party payment options to the top of the
                channel hierarchy would affect the usage levels of their in-house counterparts.

                Customer-facing platforms such as QuickBooks are in a constant state of evolution,
                resulting in frequent design changes that must be approached with care. New features
                should be incorporated into an experience without interrupting the completion of its
                most critical tasks.

            <Paragraph>
                Another implication of continuous refinement is the unfamiliarity of new features to
                even the most seasoned users. In the context of the QuickBooks payment journey,
                there was a compromise to be made between preserving the simplicity of the checkout
                workflow and surfacing important information about what payment automation entails.
