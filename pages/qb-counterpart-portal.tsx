                The Counterpart (<abbr>CP</abbr>) Portal is QuickBooks' online payment portal,
                facilitating transactions between customers and merchants. Moving over $300 million{' '}
                <abbr>USD</abbr> every day, it is a crucial component of Intuit's technology
                platform.

                I joined Intuit's Small Business and Self-Employed Group (<abbr>SBSEG</abbr>) during
                the summer of 2022, working on initiatives under the Money Design Team. Towards the
                final month of my 4-month internship, I took on a project centered around the
                reconstruction of the <abbr>CP</abbr> Portal. My responsibilities covered the entire
                design process â€” uncovering context, defining problems, outlining scope, executing
                interaction design, validating solutions, and facilitating workshops.

                    Working cross-functionally within a team distributed across three time zones, I
                    led an end-to-end redesign of the CP Portal's front-facing experience.
